<!-- REFLECTION
## Reflection

Creating this project truly strengthened my understanding of full stack development using React.js with Express.js. I believe that this project will set the foundation for an even stronger foundation in full stack development later on. Although this app's functionality was mostly completed, I want to further refactor/upgrade this project into a bookmarking, social media app that has features similar to Pinterest. The reason for this transition is because I want to provide a more usable application to a wider audience. I personally also think that it would be nice to have a designated platform where I can store all of my food/drink recommendations around the world rather than having to do a deep search within my google maps bookmarks. I would call this app "Margo", short for "Mark and go" :) -->
